    <h1><span>A</span>lter <span>S</span>ource</h1>
    <p>
        ever wanted a <b>cool</b> and <b>functional</b> sandbox mod? <br />
        well, you're in the right place! <b>Alter Source</b> has all that stuff.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <h2><i>Why?</i></h2>
    <p>
        you're right. why? why does anyone need that thing? why even listen<br />
        to anyone if you can just say <i>"KILL ALL SANDBOX MODS!!"</i> <br /> <br />
        but talking seriously, <b>Alter Source</b> was created as a <b>Garry's Mod</b> alte- <br />
        rnative, for poor people. of course, i support <b>Garry's Mod</b> <i>(GMod)</i> and all stuff, <br />
        but that doesn't mean i can't create a sandbox mod.
    </p>
    <h2>What is the cool stuff? Where?</h2>
    <div>
        <blockquote>
            there's a thing called <b>patience</b>, my <i>friend</i><br />
        </blockquote>
        <i>........ - YourLocalMoon</i>
    </div>
    <p>..no but seriously, you have to wait until <b>1.0</b> comes out for the all good stuff</p>
    <h2>Platforms?</h2>
    <p>oh! i sure can give a list of the upcoming <b>1.0</b> supported platforms, and here it is:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Windows (x64 bit)</li>
        <li>Linux   (x64 bit)</li>
        <li>Android (x64,x32 bit)</li>
        <li>MacOS</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>WHAT ARE YOUR WAYS!!! TELL ME!!</h2>
    <p>i did mistakes too. but here's some tips for modders to not be like me:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>never give up</li>
        <li>always believe in yourself</li>
        <li>use the goddamn <b><a href="https://github.com/nillerusr/source-engine">nillerusr engine</a></b> because i said so</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Is there a Discord or anything..?</h2>
    <p><b><a href="https://discord.gg/evT3ZZVmUC">of course.</a></b></p>
